# ⚙️ Challenge 3: Node Modules

_Contribute to the wider Node.js community by creating modules that export useful functions and data!_

## Description

Any discrete feature of a node project could, in theory, be bundled into its own library, module, or package. 

In this challenge, you will build a node package and deploy it to NPM.

**_When done, submit your module's GitHub repository on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/207186/assignments/844467)**_.

### Requirements

- [ ] Build a node package. You can build a simple one, a clone of another package, or an original one. If you have a very ambitious idea, please scope to just the first, core feature of your bigger vision.
- [ ] **Add the following information to your `README.md` file**
  - [ ] Module **version number badge** from [shields.io](https://shields.io)
  - [ ] Number of **downloads badge** from [shields.io](https://shields.io)
  - [ ] **Installation** and **usage** instructions
- [ ] Deploy module to NPM and turn in a link to the tracker
